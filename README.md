# learningVue
___

In order to orient and motivate myself to learn how to use Vue.js, I set myself the goal of using Vue to create an online portfolio using GitHub pages.

For now, I am primarily working through free resources found online, and I will simply be using this repository to document my progress as I move through the courses.

My company has landed on Vue.js to use for the development of our internal and external-facing web application, and I am in charge of the full scope of the project. I know backend analytics, and I know enough art and graphic design for UI design. Between these extents I am in limbo, trying to figure out what to learn, which to learn first, and how to prioritize my tasks.

#### I expect that I will find additional resources, and I plan to add them here as I work through them.
